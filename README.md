# Helwan Command Runner

A high-speed terminal-style arcade game designed to help users master **Helwan Linux (hpm)** commands through interactive gameplay.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
You control a runner in a terminal environment. Your goal is to survive while navigating through system processes and commands.

* **Grey Blocks:** System obstacles. **Avoid them** at all costs using arrow keys.
* **Red Blocks:** Locked commands. You must **type the correct command** (or its shorthand) and hit **ENTER** to destroy them before they hit you.

## ⌨️ Controls
| Action | Key |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Move Left/Right** | `Left / Right Arrow Keys` |
| **Type Command** | `A-Z Alphabet Keys` |
| **Execute/Destroy** | `ENTER` |
| **Start/Resume** | `SPACE` |
| **Quit Game** | `Q` |
