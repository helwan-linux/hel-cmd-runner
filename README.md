# Helwan Command Runner

A high-speed terminal-style arcade game designed to help users master **Helwan Linux (hpm)** commands through interactive gameplay.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
You control a runner in a terminal environment. Your goal is to survive while navigating through system processes and commands.

* **Grey Blocks:** System obstacles. **Avoid them** at all costs using arrow keys.

## ⌨️ Controls
* **Arrow Keys:** Move the runner left and right to dodge grey blocks.
* **Typing:** Type the command shown above the red blocks into the terminal bar.
* **ENTER:** Confirm the command to destroy the red block in your lane.
* **SPACE:** Start or Restart the game.
* **Q:** Quit the game immediately.
